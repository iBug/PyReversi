PyReversi is a Python implementation of the classic [Reversi][w] (aka Othello) game. It uses PyQt5 to create the GUI.

PyReversi has 5 different evaluation functions built in, and when combined with 6 different search depths, it provides 9 levels of difficulty for people with different Reversi skills to challenge.

If you can beat TaoKY, you're unarguably The Master of Reversi.

I [wrote a blog][blog] about this game.
